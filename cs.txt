OWASP :- Open web appication security project.

owasp - open web application security project (Testing)(Framework)

vulnerability :- 
----------------

---> It is a flaw in a system that can leave it open to attack.

Exploit :-
----------

---> it's a piece of software that takes advantage of a bug and causes unintented or unanticipated behavior.

VA vs PT :- Vulnerability Assesment vs Penetration Testing (Pen testing)
-----------

---> Finding the vulnerability is called vulnerability assesment.

---> Stopping the exploitation is called penetration testing.

---> To find and exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system is called penetration testing.


Security Testing Methodology :-
-------------------------------

1. Planning
2. Gathering information
3. Discovering Vulnerabilities
4. Reporting.


Web Application Testing Methodology :-
--------------------------------------

1. Information gathering
2. Planning
3. Vulnerability Detection
4. Penetration Testing
5. Reporting.

Application Penetration Testing Methodology :-
---------------------------------------------

1. Information Gathering
2. Threat Modeling
3. Vulnerability Analysis
4. Exploitation
5. Post Exploitation
6. Reporting.

---> DAST/Blackbox - Dynamic Application Security Testing.

---> If we dont know anything about the application and trying to comprimise the application is called DAST.
 
---> SAST/WhiteBox :- Static Application Security Testing.

---> Here we know about the application like sorce code plugins and ETC and trying to comprimise the application is called SAST.


Web Application :-
------------------

---> The web application is a program that performs any specific fuction using a web browser.

---> Web applications are usually coded in browser supported language such as Javascript and HTML.


Web Application Vs Website :-
-----------------------------

Web Application :- We can do some actions like login,acess the data and ETC.

Website :- We can get the information. But cant do any actions.

Methods :-
----------

GET :-
------

---> GET Method is used to request the data from specified resource.(It is used to retrive the data from server)

---> GET requests can be cached.

---> GET request remain in browser history.

POST :-
--------

---> POST method is used to send data to server.

---> POST method is used to create a resource.

---> PUT method is used to update resource.

HTTP Headers :-
---------------

---> The HTTP Headers are 4 types :-

1. General Header

2. Client-Request Header

3. Server-Response Header

4. Entity Header.

---> General Header :- Which is applicable for both request and response is called general header.

---> Client-Request Header :- It is applicable for client requests.

---> Server-Response Header :- It is applicable for your responses.

---> Entity Header :- Its tells about body meta data.

Cookies :-
----------

---> Cookies are small files that the website store on your computer to identify you quickly.

---> Inside the cookie we have session Id.

* HTTP is stateless. It wont remember you. Thats the reason we use cookies.

---> Cookies can store your credentials for some time.


RECON :-
--------

---> Recon is nothing but a information gathering.

---> Reconnaissance is a set of processes and techniques used to covertly discover and collect information about a target system.

---> There are two types of recons :-

1. Active Recon
2. Passive Recon

---> Active Recon :- In this, we are directly intract with application and gain the information.

---> This information is relevant and accurate.

---> It is risky process.

---> Passive Recon :- In this, we are indirectly intract with application and gain information.

---> In this recon we get the information from publicly available sources.

---> It is not risky.

---> Netcraft - It is a website, Here we get some information like hostnames, Ip addresses and ETC.

---> Whois Lookup 


Dorking :- 
----------

---> How google search works is 

1. URL - https://annualreport.stocklight.com

2. Title - HP Annual Report 2022

3. Text - HP Annual Report 2022. Form 10-K (NYSE:HPQ). Published: December 6th, 2022

---> Inurl - It looks for mentioned words inside the URL of any websites.

Eg :- ajio.com inurl:login

---> Intitle - It searches for any specfic word inside the page title.

Eg :- ajio.com intitle:shirts

---> Intext - It can perform queries helps to search for specfic text inside any page.

Eg :- ajio.com intext:price

---> Filetype - You can use this dork to find any kind of filetypes.
 
Eg :- hp annual reports filetype:pdf


---> If we want to see sub domains then we can use VIRUSTOTAL Website and DNSdumpster.com

---> GHDB - Google Hacking Database.

Censys.IO :-
------------

---> Censys is a platform that helps to find the information about security practitioners discover, monitor, and analyze devices that are accessable from the internet.


Installation of Kali linux :- 
----------------------------

1. Download the latest version of virtual box.

2. Extract the kali linux zip file.

3. Open the extracted file and select the linux file with 3kb. Its done.

---> Default user name - Kali

---> Default password - Kali

---> "Whatweb" is an command that we uses in CLI to find the information about applications such as IP addresses, HTTPserver Name, Cookies, Protocols, Scripts, Title and ETC.

---> While using this command extention is mandatory. (.com, .org, .in).

Eg :- whatweb facebook.com, whatweb flipkart.com


---> Wappalyzer - It is simple browser extenstion.

---> It is a tool to gather information about application.



Dirbuster :-
------------

---> It is directory penetration testing tool. it finds all directories in web application.

---> It is a brute force directories and files names on web/application servers.

---> It identifies the directories with the help of wordlist file. we can find the wordlist file in - Filesystem ---> Usr ---> Share ---> wordlists ---> Dirbuster ---> directory list.

---> brute force :- Attackers using excessively forceful attempts to gain access to user accounts.

Usage :-
--------

---> Target URL - Here we need to give URL that we want to search.

Eg :- http://testfire.com

---> File with list of dirs/files ---> Here we give the path of wordlists.

---> Eg :- Filesystem ---> Usr ---> Share ---> wordlists ---> Dirbuster ---> directory list.


LBD :- 
------

---> LBD - Load Balancer Detector.

---> It is a simple tool to find about any application using load balancer or not.

---> Eg :- lbd flipkart.com


Wafw00F :-
---------

---> It is a simple tool to find about any application using firewall or not.

---> Eg:- wafw00f dell.com
