OWASP :- Open web appication security project.

owasp - open web application security project (Testing)(Framework)

vulnerability :- 
----------------

---> It is a flaw in a system that can leave it open to attack.

Exploit :-
----------

---> it's a piece of software that takes advantage of a bug and causes unintented or unanticipated behavior.

VA vs PT :- Vulnerability Assesment vs Penetration Testing (Pen testing)
-----------

---> Finding the vulnerability is called vulnerability assesment.

---> Stopping the exploitation is called penetration testing.

---> To find and exploit vulnerabilities in a computer system is called penetration testing.


Security Testing Methodology :-
-------------------------------

1. Planning
2. Gathering information
3. Discovering Vulnerabilities
4. Reporting.


Web Application Testing Methodology :-
--------------------------------------

1. Information gathering
2. Planning
3. Vulnerability Detection
4. Penetration Testing
5. Reporting.

Application Penetration Testing Methodology :-
---------------------------------------------

1. Information Gathering
2. Threat Modeling
3. Vulnerability Analysis
4. Exploitation
5. Post Exploitation
6. Reporting.

---> DAST/Blackbox - Dynamic Application Security Testing.

---> If we dont know anything about the application and trying to comprimise the application is called DAST.
 
---> SAST/WhiteBox :- Static Application Security Testing.

---> Here we know about the application like sorce code plugins and ETC and trying to comprimise the application is called SAST.


Web Application :-
------------------

---> The web application is a program that performs any specific fuction using a web browser.

---> Web applications are usually coded in browser supported language such as Javascript and HTML.


Web Application Vs Website :-
-----------------------------

Web Application :- We can do some actions like login,acess the data and ETC.

Website :- We can get the information. But cant do any actions.

Methods :-
----------

GET :-
------

---> GET Method is used to request the data from specified resource.(It is used to retrive the data from server)

---> GET requests can be cached.

---> GET request remain in browser history.

POST :-
--------

---> POST method is used to send data to server.

---> POST method is used to create a resource.

---> PUT method is used to update resource.

HTTP Headers :-
---------------

---> The HTTP Headers are 4 types :-

1. General Header

2. Client-Request Header

3. Server-Response Header

4. Entity Header.

---> General Header :- The headers which are present in both request and response is called general header.

---> Client-Request Header :- It is applicable for client requests.

---> Server-Response Header :- It is applicable for your server responses.

---> Entity Header :- Its tells about body meta data.

Cookies :-
----------

---> Cookies are small files that the website store on your computer to identify you quickly.

---> Inside the cookie we have session Id.

* HTTP is stateless. It wont remember you. Thats the reason we use cookies.

---> Cookies can store your credentials for some time.


RECON (Phase - 2) :-
--------------------

---> Recon is nothing but a information gathering.

---> Reconnaissance is a set of processes and techniques used to covertly discover and collect information about a target system.

---> There are two types of recons :-

1. Active Recon
2. Passive Recon

---> Active Recon :- In this, we are directly intract with application and gain the information.

---> This information is relevant and accurate.

---> It is risky process.

---> Passive Recon :- In this, we are indirectly intract with application and gain information.

---> In this recon we get the information from publicly available sources.

---> It is not risky.

---> Netcraft - It is a website, Here we get some information like hostnames, Ip addresses and ETC.

Eg :- https://sitereport.netcraft.com/

---> Whois Lookup 


Dorking :- 
----------

---> How google search works is 

1. URL - https://annualreport.stocklight.com

2. Title - HP Annual Report 2022

3. Text - HP Annual Report 2022. Form 10-K (NYSE:HPQ). Published: December 6th, 2022

---> Inurl - It looks for mentioned words inside the URL of any websites.

Eg :- ajio.com inurl:login

---> Intitle - It searches for any specfic word inside the page title.

Eg :- ajio.com intitle:shirts

---> Intext - It can perform queries helps to search for specfic text inside any page.

Eg :- ajio.com intext:price

---> Filetype - You can use this dork to find any kind of filetypes.
 
Eg :- hp annual reports filetype:pdf


---> If we want to see sub domains then we can use VIRUSTOTAL Website and DNSdumpster.com

---> GHDB - Google Hacking Database.

Censys.IO :-
------------

---> Censys is a platform that helps to find the information about security practitioners discover, monitor, and analyze devices that are accessable from the internet.


Installation of Kali linux :- 
----------------------------

1. Download the latest version of virtual box.

2. Extract the kali linux zip file.

3. Open the extracted file and select the linux file with 3kb. Its done.

---> Default user name - Kali

---> Default password - Kali

---> "Whatweb" is an command that we uses in CLI to find the information about applications such as IP addresses, HTTPserver Name, Cookies, Protocols, Scripts, Title and ETC.

---> While using this command extention is mandatory. (.com, .org, .in).

Eg :- whatweb facebook.com, whatweb flipkart.com


---> Wappalyzer - It is simple browser extenstion.

---> It is a tool to gather information about application.



Dirbuster :-
------------

---> It is directory penetration testing tool. it finds all directories in web application.

---> It is a brute force directories and files names on web/application servers.

---> It identifies the directories with the help of wordlist file. we can find the wordlist file in - Filesystem ---> Usr ---> Share ---> wordlists ---> Dirbuster ---> directory list.

---> brute force :- Attackers using excessively forceful attempts to gain access to user accounts.

Usage :-
--------

---> Target URL - Here we need to give URL that we want to search.

Eg :- http://testfire.net

---> File with list of dirs/files ---> Here we give the path of wordlists.

---> Eg :- Filesystem ---> Usr ---> Share ---> wordlists ---> Dirbuster ---> directory list.


LBD :- 
------

---> LBD - Load Balancer Detector.

---> It is a simple tool to find about any application using load balancer or not.

---> Eg :- lbd flipkart.com


Wafw00F :-
---------

---> It is a simple tool to find about any application using firewall or not.

---> Eg:- wafw00f dell.com


nmap :-
------

---> nmap :- Network mapper. Nmap is used to identify the live hosts, ports and os versions that applications using.

---> By default nmap checks only 1000 well known ports.

---> If we didnt mention any scan type than default scan is SYN Scan. 

---> There are two types of scans :-

1. Syn Scan

2. TCP Scan

---> SYN Scan :- This scan is two way handshake (1.Syn packet, 2.Syn ack)

---> Before using the Syn scan make sure that we need root privileges. For that use this command to switch to root account - sudo su.

---> Syn Scan is faster.

---> Eg :- nmap -sS testfire.net (nmap -> Command, -s -> Here we mention the scan type, testfire.net - Here we need to mention website name).

---> TCP Scan :- This scan is three way handshake (1. Syn packet, 2. Syn ack, 3. Response Acknowledged)

---> Eg :- nmap -sT testfire.net

---> To do TCP scan we don't need root privilegs.


Zenmap :-
---------

---> It is same as nmap but it is GUI.

---> To see the IP address in kali linux we use this command - ifconfig. In windows the command is ipconfig.

---> nmap -sV 10.1.10.88/24  ---> nmap ---> command, -s Scan type, -V ---> It shows the version(Need to use caps V), 10.1.10.88/24 ---> website IP.

---> nmap -sV -A -O 10.1.10.88/24 ---> nmap -> command, -s Scan type, -V --> It shows the version(Need to use caps V), -A,-O ---> It shows the OS and OS version (Here we can use 'A' or 'O' both shows the same content), 10.1.10.88/24 --> website IP.

---> nmap -p 3000-4000 10.1.10.80 ---> nmap -> command, -p ---> it shows the ports(If you want check between specfic ports from 3000 to 4000), 10.1.10.88/24 --> website IP.

---> Eg :- nmap -p 1-65535 10.1.10.80

---> nmap -p 1-65535 -T5 10.1.10.80 ---> nmap -> command, -p ---> it shows the ports(If you want check between specfic ports from 3000 to 4000), -T5 ---> If we want to scan more faster we use this(T stands for timing templates), 10.1.10.88/24 --> website IP

---> T0 - Paranoid
---> T1 - Sneaky
---> T2 - Polite
---> T3 - Normal
---> T4 - Aggressive
---> T5 - Insane.


Discovering vulnerabilities (phase - 3) :-
------------------------------------------

A2 - Broken Authentication :-
-----------------------------

Authentication :-
-----------------

---> Authentication is nothing but verifing the identity.

---> We can identify the users by thier username and password.

HTTP Basic Authentication :-
----------------------------

---> In this method client always provide the username and password when making the request.

---> For every request username and password will send to server, that will send by Authentication header.

** Authentication : Basic ---> If we see Authentication header along with basic than it is called HTTP Basic Authentication.


Encoding :-
-----------

---> Converting your data into another format. Here we use base64.

---> Eg :- ToBase64 - Pranith, FromBase64 - UHJhbml0aA==

---> Eg :- original format - 125485abc  Encoded format - cdcsd6554dfsdvd5sd4


Encryption :-
-------------

---> Converting your data into cipher text. (AES)

---> It is two way process encrypt and decrypt.

---> Eg :- AES Encrypt - Pranith(input), AES Decrypt - 62437b89a709277468362ca9ea7e9b60(Output) 


---> In AES encrypt 128 bit key contains 32 charcters. (16 bytes = AES-128)

---> In AES encrypt 192 bit key contains 48 charcters. (24 bytes = AES-192)

---> In AES encrypt 256 bit key contains 64 charcters. (32 bytes = AES-256)

---> For all bits IV contains 32 charcters.

Hashing :-
----------

---> Conventing your data into different format. (SHA512 - Secure hasing algorithm)

---> It is one way process.


---> To do these actions we use "Cyberchef" - (Web Application).


Cookie Based Authentication :-
------------------------------

---> In cookie based authentication cookie is the header.

---> Cookie is created by server.

---> Cookie contains session ID.

---> Session Id is unique for everyone.

---> Session Id has expiration date.

---> When browser send request to server, Sever put the SET Cookie header.

HTTP vs Local Storage :-

Token :-

Header, Payload, Signature

Brute force attacks using burp.


Username Enumeration through password reset :-
----------------------------------------------

---> Finding the username or email id is called username enumeration.

---> There are two ways :-

1. Password Reset

2. Login Page

3. Sign Up page.

---> First we need to know weather the username or email id is already existing or not.

---> Open any website (Snapchat) and press login and give any random username to check is it available or not.

---> If the given username is not found we get a message like this "We cannot find an account for this email address" ---> If we get this kinda response than we knew that user is not existing.

---> If the gave an username and if we get a message like this "If we have an account for the username or email address you provided we have emailed a link to reset your password." ---> If we get this kinda response than we did not know that user is existing or not. (Perfect Implementation)

---> If we want check multiple user combinations we can use burp.

Login page user enumeration :-
------------------------------

---> In this enumeration we can find weather username or email id existing or not at sign up page.

---> While creating the user we need to give the information Like Name , emailid etc at the creation time, If it already availble than we know that user is already existing.

Ensure if the data is sent through a secure channel :-
------------------------------------------------------

---> Post method is used for sending the data and it is secure.

---> We can change Post method into GET method by using burp tool. It has a default option.

---> If the data is send in GET method then that application has vulnerability.

---> Using HTTPS

Session Invalidation (Using Cookies - Pre & Post Logout) :-
----------------------------------------------------------

---> If we logged out from the session and still we are seeing the same data than it is called session invalidation.

---> If we logged out from the session than cookies also be deleted, If the cookies still availble than that application has vulnerability. 

Account Lockout :-
------------------

---> If we enters the wrong password for multiple time than the account got locked.
